I am writing to dispute an error in the medical bill I received dated July 1, 2023, with the invoice number 12245.\n\nUpon close examination of the invoice, I noted that there is an error in the calculation of the amount due. The subtotal listed on the invoice is $745.00 for a full body check-up and an ear and throat examination. However, the total amount due is stated as $1,745.00, which is a discrepancy of $1,000.00. I believe this is an error, as the detailed breakdown of the services rendered does not account for this additional cost.\n\nI kindly request that you review this discrepancy and provide me with an updated invoice reflecting the correct amount. If there is an additional service or cost that I have overlooked, I kindly ask that you provide a detailed explanation for the additional $1,000.00.\n\nOnce the correction has been made, please inform me of the next steps concerning payment. I am committed to settling this matter promptly and maintaining a positive relationship with your esteemed establishment.\n\nI appreciate your attention to this matter and trust that you will rectify this error as soon as possible. Please do not hesitate to contact me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email] should you require additional information or if there are any further steps I need to take.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]",
